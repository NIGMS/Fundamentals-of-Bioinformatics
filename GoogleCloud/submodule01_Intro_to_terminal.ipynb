If you have not used a terminal environment to interact with genomic data you might have used a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* which is a pictorial wrapper for the terminal environment. Rather than passing commands through a keyboard a GUI enables you to select preinstalled options that can be handed to the operating system. \n",

These options may not be optimal for the dataset that you are working with, and the software might not be the latest version. When this happens you will run into what we call \"bugs\" where the GUI crashes or times out before the data are processed. In this case you may be able to update your GUI, but often you're left looking desperately for another tool that will do something similar. \n",

This enables more flexibility in your analysis and the ability to leverage options that are optimal for processing your dataset. Lastly when the software does crash there is generally an error message or a log file explaining what process caused the crash. Mitigating these issues requires a little \"google-fu\" on your part combing through stack exchange messages where previous users of the same software got the same error message and have implemented various fixes, more on this in submodule 7 **Error mitigation**. \n"
