Reads are connected by building a graph where each read is a node and edges represent k-mer overlaps between the ends of other nodes (reads). The series of overlapping pieces between reads are used to build and extend a consensus sequence in an iterative process to build the longest possible sequence with the overlapping reads. The final fasta file produced, in spades this is called `scaffolds.fasta`, is the set of sequences created by connecting reads to form the longest possible sequences.\n",
